This is a repo to host the (Markdown) source files of my personal website learned from [yihui](https://yihui.org/cn/about/).


To build the website locally, you can clone yihui's repo with its submodule, such as,
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:rbind/yihui.git
```
and you can clone yihui's hugo-theme, e.g.,
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:yihui/hugo-ivy.git
```

The website is built via the R package [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) created by yihui. Please read its documentation for how to use it.

More details can be see in [here](https://github.com/rbind/yihui).
